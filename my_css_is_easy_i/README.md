# Welcome to My Css Is Easy I

## Task
Create html page with css that uses flexbox to display a desktop and mobile view.

## Description
Each section will have their names displayed (ex: in the header component you will have the word header, hero for hero, etc.)
Use some padding to make it smooth.
Header will have a background color: 00B7EB
Hero will have a background color: FF0000
Content will have a background color: 00FF00
Sidebar will have a background color: 800080
Footer will have a background color: 444444

Mobile view is defined as a screen width less than 640px
Desktop view is defined as a screen width bigger than 640px
Some browsers create a margin inside the body tag.
To get rid of it:
body {
    margin: 0px !important;
}
