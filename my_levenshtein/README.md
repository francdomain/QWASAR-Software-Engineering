# Welcome to My Levenshtein
***

## Task
The problem is to write an algorithm that calculates the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two words.

## Description
The Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number is a value that represents how similar two given strings are.
It is found by comparing two strings and returning the difference between them. 
for example, "abc" and "dbc".
The Levenshtein difference between these two strings is 1. The two strings are almost identical, other than one letter. 
That letter, 'd', is close to the example, 'a', meaning the Levenshtein value will be small.

The function takes in 2 strings with the exact number of characters and return an integer representing the difference between them.
If the parameters are not the same size then the function will return -1.
If the two strings are the same size, iterate through each string and determine which characters are different.
Each time there is a difference, it counts as 1.

## Installation
The project is installed using the node package manager i.e npm


## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
It is used to measure the difference between two words.
It is used in natural language processing e.g correction of spelling mistakes.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
