# Welcome to My Roman Numerals Converter

## Task
Write a function to convert normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

## Description
The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. 
(notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to carve into stone tablets).

 1  => I
10  => X
 7  => VII
There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each
digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any
digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the number 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII

It will return a string with the roman numeral.

Example 00

Input: 14
Output: 
Return Value: "XIV"
Example 01

Input: 79
Output: 
Return Value: "LXXIX"
Example 02

Input: 845
Output: 
Return Value: "DCCCXLV"
Example 03

Input: 2022
Output: 
Return Value: "MMXXII"

## Installation
The project can be installed by the command install package name

## Usage
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numerals, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
