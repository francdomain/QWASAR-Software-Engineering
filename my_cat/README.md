# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.

## Description
Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software.
Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options.

Example:
language = "Javascript"

$>node my_cat file1
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>

Example Python

$>python my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>

Example Ruby

$>ruby my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>

Example java

$>java my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>

Example Rust <3

$>./my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>

## Installation
The project can be installed by using make.

## Usage
It reads data from the file and gives their content as output. 
It helps us to create, view, concatenate files.
```
./my_cat argument1 argument2
```
